This document is meant to provide you with the capability to reproduce our results, give an explanation of all relevant files, and provide you with the proper order of operations. 

To start, in our R-project a few files were automatically generated, and this may differ depending on your version of R-studio. The files we had were: RprojUser and Rhistory. Do not delete auto-generated files, because you may interfere with your R project.

Our Source Data file is ‘FSB_BI_Survey_2019_2021.rds’ , you will need to use our Student SUccess R project before doing anything else with the data. Once the R-project is open, run the Data Cleaning RMD file.This will result in the ‘datacleaned.csv’ file, which is much easier to use in a data analytics environment. The next step is to begin creating the dashboard and interactive elements for the client. Run the Final Dashboard RMD file, and you now have run all necessary files to produce our results and dashboard.

A list of extra files that will be in this zip folder include, this README, a computing environment file generated by our Data Cleaning file, which is useful for reproducibility, a PNG of our business value proposition, and a shell template and knitted shell template that are there for reference when creating the final dashboard.
